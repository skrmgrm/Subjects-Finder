# Cea Subjects Finder Webapp

**Motivation**

> During enrollment, students are always frustrated because we can’t find our subjects’ google classroom codes, and groups. The idea of this web app is to provide information about the subjects offered in the current semester. Each item will contain the subject description, code, schedule, google classroom code, and Facebook group link if available. This web app will also feature a search bar to easily find the subject codes as well as crud operations to input and display information.
